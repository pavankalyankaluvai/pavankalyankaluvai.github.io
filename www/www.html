        <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), also known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Web was initially developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks, and hypertext into a powerful and easy-to-use global information system.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypertext:</strong> The ability to link to other documents or resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimedia:</strong> Integration of text, images, videos, and audio.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Content:</strong> Forms, games, and applications that respond to user input.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Access from anywhere in the world through the Internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Components of the Web</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Software applications like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that retrieve, present, and traverse information resources on the Web.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Computers that store web resources and respond to requests from web browsers.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The standard markup language used to create web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>URLs:</strong> Uniform Resource Locators, which provide a way to identify and locate resources on the Web.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web has revolutionized the way we access and share information. It has transformed industries, enabled new forms of communication, and created countless opportunities for innovation and collaboration. The Web continues to evolve, shaping the future of technology and society.</p>
